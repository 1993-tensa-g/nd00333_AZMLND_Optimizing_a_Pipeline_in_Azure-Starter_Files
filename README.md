# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
** Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm. **

** What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose? **

** What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose? **

## AutoML
** Describe the model and parameters generated by AutoML. **

## Pipeline comparison
** Compare the two models and their performance. **

## Future work
** What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements improve the model?**
